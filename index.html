<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Extermz! This is a page displaying some of the stuff I worked on in class this semester.</p>

<h2>Too Comfortable</h2>
<img src="TC.jpg" alt="Game's Starting Screen" width="1154" height="718">

<p>By far what I'm most proud of this semester. For context, I start solo game development in October, which was a magical experience! All of my time went into thinking about or making games for quite a while there. As a result, I often missed school assignments because I got too focused on my own games, and then burnt out right before finals... (Improvement for Spring!)</p>

<p>Back on track, the project here was to create an interactive experience discussing an issue with societal, political, or global relevance. I wanted to talk about the dangers of parasocial relationships online, as that's one of the things I'm passionate about. I was a bit hesistant at first if I could call this a societal problem, but I genuinely believe if this isn't properly addressed, the internet will only become more dangerous. Since there wasn't a restriction on the medium, I felt now was a good time to bridge my academic and personal work to try and elevate both.</p>

<p>For this, I used Godot amd a plugin called Dialogic, which is used for streamlining dialogue systems, making it easier to put a lot of it in your game. I got to learn a lot about how the plugin works, as well as how to properly use BBcode in Godot (which adds text effects like different colors and animation). Overall, the most fun project of this semester</p>
 
<h2>Duck Guesser</h2>

<p>One of my personal favorites! For this assignment, we had to create a site where a player could type in a number, trying to guess how many ducks will appear when they hit enter. We were given a template to base our work on, but I actually had a little trouble displaying my (amazing) duck images.</p>

<p>In the end, my solution was to stop making a media folder, since the link to it would never work, and instead have the image floating in my project folder, next to my html, js, and css files. A bit sloppy but it works, and the project is small scale enough that organization isn't an issue. After that, I just made the site more aesthetically pleasing using css.</p>

<h2>Weather Visualization</h2>
<img src="weather.jpg" alt="weather site" width="1090" height="737">

<p>For this assignment, we need to create a graph showing an area's temperature forecast. It originally just had blue for cold, green for cool, and red for hot, but I believed that it lacked proper nuance (and that the ranges weren't fully accurate).</p>

<p>To remedy this, I added another shade of green so I could add a "Comfortable Temperature" option to the graph, since not all cooler temperatures are nice to be in. I also expanded the range to make anything under 50F considered cold, since I personally dislike weather in the 40s. I also made the background darker (but maybe a bit too dark...)</p>

<h2>Doodle App</h2>
<img src="doodle.jpg" alt="doodle site" width="1011" height="651">

<p>This next one is less something, I'm proud of, and more something I'm fascinated by.</p>

<p>The premise for this one was to make a site that functioned similarly to Google's "Quick, Draw!" where the player sketches an object from a prompt, and the AI has to identify what it is. It was an exercise in getting the data set, along with Javascript, to recreate the game on a smaller scale</p>

<p>The reason I'm not particularly proud of this one is I didn't make any major changes from what I was shown, only changing the background color and stroke weight of the drawn lines. The reason I still wanted to display this on the site, however, is due to how interesting the concept is. I want to know why the AI's guesses were so inaccurate on our site compared to Google's, and what practical applications this kind of thing can have in other types of games. This is here as more of a reminder of something I want to study on my own.</p>

<h2>Image Detector</h2>
<img src="image_detector.jpg" alt="detector site" width="915" height="637">
<p>(He is NOT a toilet seat)</p>

<p>This one functions much like the doodle site, only instead of guessing what a drawing is, it guesses what an image is. If you try and put a drawing into it, like I did, the AI gives a very shoddy result. But again I wonder "why?" Why does it struggle with drawn images in this data set? Is there any way I can use something like this in a game? This is another assignment where I was more interested in the concept, rather than what I did for it.</p>

<h2>"Why Do You Always Use Comic Sans MS?"</h2>

<p>The astute among you may have noticed that I make the font in a lot of my work Comic Sans. This is for two reasons. One is I find it visually pleasing, as I find it more gentle on the eyes, if it makes sense. It feels less sterile than Arial or Times New Roman. The second reason is, like other san-serif fonts, the letters are easier for people with dyslexia to read, which is something I learned recently. Of course there are other options that some people with dyslexia prfer, including Arial, but this is just the font I prefer. And if it makes one person's reading experience a little easier, then it's worth it. (Also I type all of my notes in Comic Sans so my eyes don't hurt)</p>
